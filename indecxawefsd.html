        <h1>Food Nutrition Guide: 20 Common Foods</h1>
        <p>Understanding what's in your food is key to a healthy lifestyle. Here's a look at the general nutritional content of 20 common food items.</p>

        <h2>General Nutrition Categories Explained</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Primary source of energy. Found in grains, fruits, vegetables, and dairy.</li>
            <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Essential for building and repairing tissues, enzymes, and hormones. Found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, and nuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Provide energy, support cell growth, absorb nutrients, and produce hormones. Found in oils, nuts, seeds, meat, and dairy. Both healthy (unsaturated) and unhealthy (saturated and trans) fats exist.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitamins:</strong> Organic compounds vital for normal growth and nutrition. Examples: Vitamin C (immune health), Vitamin A (vision), B Vitamins (energy metabolism).</li>
            <li><strong>Minerals:</strong> Inorganic elements crucial for body functions. Examples: Calcium (bone health), Iron (oxygen transport), Potassium (fluid balance).</li>
            <li><strong>Fiber:</strong> Type of carbohydrate that aids digestion, helps regulate blood sugar, and promotes satiety. Found in plant-based foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Essential for all bodily functions, including nutrient transport and temperature regulation.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Ranking of Most Unhealthiest Foods (from the list above, or general knowledge)</h3>
            <p>It's important to note that "unhealthiest" can be subjective and depends on portion size and overall dietary pattern. However, based on general nutritional advice emphasizing moderation of processed ingredients, high sugar, unhealthy fats, and sodium, here's a ranking of some common foods often considered less healthy, along with a brief explanation:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sodas/Sugary Drinks:</strong> These are often cited as among the unhealthiest due to extremely high added sugar content and virtually no nutritional value. They contribute significantly to weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and dental problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep-fried Foods (e.g., French Fries, Fried Chicken):</strong> High in unhealthy fats (often trans fats or saturated fats from frying oil) and sodium. They contribute to high calorie intake and can lead to cardiovascular issues and weight gain.</li>
                <li><strong>Processed Meats (e.g., Bacon):</strong> High in saturated fat, sodium, and often contain nitrates/nitrites, which have been linked to increased risk of certain cancers and heart disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Ice Cream:</strong> Typically very high in added sugar and saturated fat, contributing to high calorie intake and potential weight gain if consumed in large quantities.</li>
                <li><strong>White Bread/Refined Grains:</strong> While not inherently "bad," they are often stripped of fiber and nutrients during processing. They can cause rapid blood sugar spikes compared to whole grains, potentially leading to energy crashes and contributing to insulin resistance over time.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This ranking is based on general nutritional guidelines and the typical composition of these foods. A balanced diet emphasizes variety and moderation. Even "unhealthy" foods can be enjoyed occasionally as part of an otherwise healthy lifestyle.</p>
